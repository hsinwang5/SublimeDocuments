        <ul>
            <li>e.target references current target for event delegation</li>
            <li>e.target.classList.item[index] retrieves classes on all browsers.
                The value property only works in chrome/firefox. 
                Event delegation can be simulated using if statements with vanilla
                js.
            </li>
            <li>With vanilla JS, nodelist creates a tree structure that 
                can be accessed using chained selector methods like 
                element.lastchild.lastchild.firstchild.etc
            </li>
            <li>Do not use innerHTML to assign user input - easily exploited
                because it sets the actual html on the page
            </li>
            <li>ie11 and down do not support node.remove().</li>
            <li>metaphors for software development help to enhance understanding of 
                the process and reduce costs. There are both bad and good metaphors 
                depending on the size/type of task - bad metaphors restrict progress, 
                like the earth-central view of solar system, while good models 
                allow progress to proceeed, like the sun-centric 
                solar system model. 
            </li>
            <li>box-sizing: border-box is a CSS property that calculates element sizes
                by including the padding and border into the entire size caluclation
            </li>
            <li>Back-end development creates dynamic webpages that deliver content based 
                on server requests - ie PUT, GET, etc. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>3-19-2018 Summary</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Different web applications require different kinds of planning - 
                the more complicated the app, the more planning will reduce costs
            </li>
            <li>There is no one specific tool to use for all problems - the correct 
                software stack should be chosen based on best fit.
            </li>
            <li>Quality must be emphasized throughout the development process. Testing 
                cannot modify a program's fundamentals - testing can make sure that 
                a toyota prius runs perfectly, but can't turn that prius into 
                a BMW coupe. 
            </li>
            <li>cloud 9 cloud development environment - IDE + all project files 
                can run on a separate machine. Setup of cloud development environment
            </li>
            <li>Command line basics for back-end navigation: mkdir, cd, ls, touch, 
                node, rm, rm -rf flag, directory/file creation and navigation.
            </li>
            <li>running js apps via node - very similar to running javascript 
                in the browser, but no document object/methods related to browsers
            </li>
            <li>basics of npm packages/libraries - most apps are built and written 
                with the support of a large set of packages in addition to just 
                the basic javascript
            </li>
            <li>Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, Undefined are all simple types 
                and immutable. All other types of data are Objects. This includes 
                things like arrays, functions, and regexp. 
            </li>
            <li>An object property's value can be obtained from any expression, 
                including other objects, Objects can be nested.
            </li>
        </ul>
